# Workstation Setup

 In order to develop for Guide.js you have to...

0. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
0. Install  [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

...and of course the JavaScript IDE of your choice (I use [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)).

# Conventions

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) by simply executing ```grunt``` from the command line in this project's root directory.

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via grunt._
