#Guide visitors through your website with Guide.js
==================================================

In case the interface of your web application is not self-explanatory: Here comes Guide.js!

With Guide.js you can augment your website with assisting features like...

0. temporarily displaying help overlays or
0. creating guided tours (utilizing 'Guiders').

For a complete overview about Guidejs' functionality refer to the [defined use cases](https://github.com/TheLeanMachine/Guide.js/blob/master/USE_CASES.md).

Guide.js is intended to be used with multiple JavaScript libraries, but in this early stage we only test with [jQuery](http://jquery.org/).
